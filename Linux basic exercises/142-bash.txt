# Answer to exercise "14.0 User commands-14.2 Bash 3"

#      ** User commands can be added to shell startup files
#      ** Bash: ~/.bashrc and Zsh (Mac): ~/.zshrc
#         Write a user command that displays only files.


alias lsf='ls -p | grep -v /'
or
alias lsf='ls -F | grep -v /'


Explanation:
  This command will use the ls command to list all the files and directories in the current directory, 
  and the -p option will append a slash to the end of directory names to distinguish them from files. 
  The output will then be piped to grep, which will filter out any lines containing a slash (which are directories) 
  using the -v option. This will leave only the names of files, which will be displayed on the screen.


TESTING:
jingjing@debian:~$ ls
 Desktop   Documents   Downloads   file2.doc   file.txt   Music   Pictures   Public   Templates   tmp   Videos
jingjing@debian:~$ ls -p | grep -v /
file2.doc
file.txt

jingjing@debian:~$ lsf
file2.doc
file.txt


# End of file
