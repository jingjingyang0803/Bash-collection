# Answer to exercise "6.0 Archiving file-6.3 Tar 1"

# Problem: Give command to create a tar package "package.tar.gz" by backing up everything under "~/tmp/" and its sub directories.
#          Compress tar packet using gzip(1).
#          NOTE: Make sure the TAR package does not have absolute pathslike "/home/user/tmp/..."


cd ; tar -zcvf ~/package.tar.gz tmp/

#  In recursive mode, you must not create archive to the same directory which is being tarred up, 
#  because then the tar would include "itself".

#  -z        gzip compress support (GNU tar only)
#  -c        create new archive
#  -v        verbose
#  -f NAME   use archive file NAME

# End of file
