# Answer to exercise "10.0 Egrep command-10.3 Egrep 3"

#        Give command to search database for all people that have "a" in their *first* name.


assume that all *first* names are started with a uppercase letter and followed by several lowercase letters:
       egrep ", [A-Z][a-z]*a" data.txt

assume that *first* names are mixed with uppercase and lowercase letters:
       egrep ", [a-zA-Z]*a" data.txt
