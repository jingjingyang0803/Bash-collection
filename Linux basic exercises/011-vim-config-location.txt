# Answer to exercise "1.1 VIM configuration location"

# Problem: Where is the vim(1) configuration file located?


~/.vimrc


# Vim can be configured system wide (globally) via the /etc/vim/vimrc.local file on Ubuntu/Debian based operating systems. 

# Vim's user-specific configuration file is located in the HOME directory.
# (touch ~/.vimrc) First create a .vimrc file in the HOME directory of the user that you want to configure Vim for.
# (vim ~/.vimrc) Then add the required Vim configuration options(eg. set number) there.
