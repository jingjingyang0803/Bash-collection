# Answer to exercise "3.0 Meta character for pipe-3.3 Pipe 3"

# Problem: Write command to save nano(1) manual page to file nano-manual.txt.
#          Before saving, pipe the manual page content through col(1) to remove any special control characters.


man nano | col -bx > nano-manual.txt


Explanation:
This command pipes the output of the man command for nano to the col command, which filters out any special control characters from the text. 
The -b option in the col command specifies that only backspaces and newlines should be honored, and all other control characters should be removed.
The filtered output is then redirected to the file nano-manual.txt using the > symbol. 
This command will save a clean, filtered version of the manual page to the specified file.


# Col reads from standard input and writes to standard output.
#    -b: This option specifies that only backspaces and newlines should be honored, and all other control characters should be removed.
#    -f: This option treats form feeds (ASCII code 12) as newlines, and prints each line separately.
#    -l: This option treats line feeds (ASCII code 10) as newlines, and prints each line separately.
#    -n: This option specifies that the output should not be split into lines, and all control characters should be removed.
#    -x: This option treats carriage returns (ASCII code 13) as newlines, and prints each line separately.
