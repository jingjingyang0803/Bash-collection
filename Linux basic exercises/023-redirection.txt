# Answer to exercise "2.3 Redirection 3"

# Explain why nothing appears in file "2":  echo 2 2> 2


The file descriptor for standard error is 2.
Using “2>” we re-direct the error output to a file named “2”.
Howerver, there is no error for command "echo 2", so file "2" has no contents to show.


Instead, the file descriptor for standard output is 1.
If we give command :echo 2 1> 2, file "2" would have : 2
If we give command :echo 123456 1> 2, file "2" would have : 123456


TESTING:
root@debian:~# echo 2 2> 2
2
root@debian:~# cat 2
root@debian:~# echo 2 1> 2
root@debian:~# cat 2
2


# If we do not want a file to be overwritten but want to add more content to an existing file, then we should use ‘>>‘ operator.
