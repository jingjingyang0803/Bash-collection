# Answer to exercise "3.0 Meta character for pipe-3.1 Pipe 1"

# Problem: Two of these are nonsense. Which ones? Suppose that the "file" exists.
#     	 	   1. cat file | ls > file
#       	   2. ls | cat | less
#     		   3. cat < file | less
#     		   4. ls | less > cat file


(1) and (4) are nonsense.
(1) has overwritting issue.
(4) uses wrong file name.


Explanation:
    (1) tries to list the contents of the file named "file", and then redirect the output to a file named "file". 
        However, this will overwrite the contents of the file "file" with the output of the "ls" command, which is a list of files in the current directory, not the contents of the original "file". Therefore, this command does not make sense.
    (2) lists the files in the current directory, then passes the output to the "cat" command, which simply displays the output, 
        and then pipes the output of "cat" to the "less" command, which displays the output one screen at a time. 
        This command makes sense and is a common way to view the output of long directory listings.
    (3) reads the contents of the file named "file", 
        and then passes the output to the "less" command, which displays the output one screen at a time. 
        This command makes sense and is a common way to view the contents of files in the terminal.
    (4) tries to list the files in the current directory, 
        then pipe the output to the "less" command, which displays the output one screen at a time, 
        and then redirect the output to a file named "cat file". 
        However, this will create a file named "cat file" with the output of the "less" command, not the contents of the original "file". 
        Therefore, this command does not make sense.


# End of file
